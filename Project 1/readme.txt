I have used spotify dataset in this project to train my models . basically i have used 4 models 
1- k-means 
2- naive bayes 
3-Logistic Regression
4-Random Forest
I have used these models to predict the genre of the songs
This project helped me gain knowledge of how to work with datasets in AI and how to clean data for bigger projects and how a models training effects its prediction and quality.
